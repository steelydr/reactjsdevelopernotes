# React.js Mastery Roadmap

## á½¿0 Beginner Level â€“ Foundations
> Goal: Understand the basics of React and build simple components and apps.

### 1. JavaScript Prerequisites (ES6+)
- `let`, `const`, arrow functions
- Template literals
- Destructuring
- Spread/rest operators
- Modules (`import` / `export`)
- Array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`)
- Promises, async/await

### 2. React Fundamentals
- What is React and why use it?
- JSX Syntax
- Functional components vs Class components
- `create-react-app` setup
- Rendering elements
- Component structure and nesting
- Props and PropTypes
- State and `useState` hook
- Event handling
- Conditional rendering
- Lists and `key` props
- Basic forms and controlled components
- Styling (CSS, CSS Modules, inline styles)

---

## á½¾1 Intermediate Level â€“ Dynamic Applications
> Goal: Learn state management, component interaction, and data fetching.

### 3. Component Architecture
- Lifting state up
- Reusable components
- Component composition
- Container vs Presentational components

### 4. React Hooks (Core)
- `useEffect` for side effects
- `useRef` for DOM reference
- `useContext` for shared state
- Custom hooks

### 5. Forms in Depth
- Handling multiple form fields
- Form validation (manual and libraries like Yup)
- Error handling

### 6. React Router (v6+)
- Installing and setup
- Route, Link, Navigate
- `useParams`, `useNavigate`
- Nested routes
- Protected routes

### 7. State Management
- Local vs global state
- `useReducer`
- Context API (basic global state)
- Introduction to Redux or Zustand

### 8. Fetching Data
- Using `fetch` or `axios`
- Async `useEffect` for API calls
- Loading and error states
- Pagination, search, filtering

### 9. Project Structure
- Folder structure for scalability
- Constants, utils, assets
- Environment variables (`.env`)

---

## ðŸ”µ Advanced Level â€“ Scalable & Performant Applications
> Goal: Optimize, structure, and scale production-level apps.

### 10. Advanced React Hooks
- `useMemo` and `useCallback`
- `React.memo`
- `useLayoutEffect` vs `useEffect`
- `useImperativeHandle`
- Custom hook architecture patterns

### 11. Performance Optimization
- Virtualization (e.g., `react-window`)
- Lazy loading with `React.lazy` and `Suspense`
- Code splitting
- Debouncing and throttling
- Avoiding unnecessary renders

### 12. Redux (Advanced) / Zustand / Recoil / Jotai
- Redux Toolkit
- Async operations with `redux-thunk` or `redux-saga`
- Store architecture
- DevTools integration

### 13. Testing in React
- Unit testing with **Jest**
- Component testing with **React Testing Library**
- Mocking API calls
- End-to-end testing with **Cypress** or **Playwright**

### 14. TypeScript with React
- Type annotations for props, state, events
- Interfaces and types
- Generics in components/hooks
- Type-safe API calls

### 15. Authentication & Authorization
- Login/signup flows
- Token storage (localStorage vs cookies)
- Role-based access
- OAuth (e.g., Google, GitHub)

### 16. React and Backend Integration
- REST APIs
- GraphQL with Apollo
- WebSockets
- Firebase or Supabase integration

### 17. Deployment
- Building and deploying with Vite or CRA
- Hosting on **Netlify**, **Vercel**, or **Firebase**
- CI/CD basics (GitHub Actions)

---

## ðŸ”¸ Expert Level â€“ Production Ready
> Goal: Build enterprise-grade applications and contribute to large-scale projects.

### 18. Server-Side Rendering & SSR Frameworks
- Next.js basics and advanced
- Static Site Generation (SSG) vs SSR vs CSR
- API routes and middleware

### 19. Micro-Frontend Architecture
- Module federation (Webpack 5)
- Independent deployments
- Communication between micro-frontends

### 20. Design Systems & Component Libraries
- Storybook for isolated components
- Building your own design system
- Using libraries: MUI, Ant Design, Tailwind CSS

### 21. Accessibility (a11y)
- Semantic HTML
- ARIA attributes
- Screen reader-friendly components

### 22. Internationalization (i18n)
- Using `react-i18next`
- Language switching
- Formatting dates, currencies

- Working with Monorepos (Turborepo, Nx)
- AI Integration (OpenAI API)
- Real-time apps with Socket.IO
